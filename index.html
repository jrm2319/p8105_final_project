<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
<p>With the New Year right around the corner, countless sources are
providing their list of the ‘Best Books’ of the year. These lists help
inform readers while providing them with book recommendations that
interest them. Our overarching goal is to understand trends of readers
using Goodreads.</p>
<p>Goodreads is an online platform to find, share, and rate books
readers have read. This information can help publishers, authors, and
libraries tailor their book selections to meet reader’s demands and
promote lesser-known genres and authors. Understanding this can also
help explore cultural trends that resonate with the public, while
identifying or creating opportunities for reader re-engagement.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-inspiration" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Project Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>With the demanding workload of graduate school, there’s little time
to sit down and enjoy a good book. However, with winter break
approaching, we’re all looking forward to some much-needed rest and the
chance to indulge in quality reading time! This project was inspired by
a shared hobby among our team and our collective anticipation for the
opportunity to relax on the couch, sip some coffee, and dive into a good
book.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h3>
<p>The initial research question of our project was: What are trends
among readers? This initial research question aided us when exploring
datasets. Once we found <a
href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">GoodBooks-10K</a>, an
open data source hosted on GitHub with data from Goodreads, we were
interested in exploring trends among readers using Goodreads. The team
spent time understand what data was available and then created the
following questions to guide this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the top fifteen Goodreads users, by Ratings and
To-Read?</li>
<li>Are sequels worth reading?</li>
<li>What are the top 10 most and least popular genres?</li>
<li>Who are the top 10 most and least popular authors?</li>
<li>How can we build a recommendations page based on the data
provided?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Data</strong></h3>
<p>The original data for this project is from <a
href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">GoodBooks-10K</a> and
is from an open data source hosted on GitHub with data from Goodreads.
We used the following datasets from the original <a
href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">GoodBooks-10K</a> data:
book_tags.csv, books.csv, ratings.csv, tags.csv, and to_read.csv.</p>
<p>Our main dataset is called books_with_tags. This dataset was created
by merging the books.csv with book_tags.csv. This dataset had a sample
size of 9300 books and each book has five top tags. On Goodreads, tags
are non-exclusive virtual shelves that users can organize their books
on. In the raw data, books had between 1-25 tags, we took the five most
common tags for each book and kept those in the books_with_tags.csv
dataset. The tags in this dataset are used as proxies for genres.</p>
<p>The books_with_tags dataset contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>book_id</strong>: book id for this dataset</li>
<li><strong>goodreads_book_id</strong>:book id for the most popular
version of the book, according to Goodreads</li>
<li><strong>isbn</strong>: International Standard Book Number</li>
<li><strong>authors</strong>: author name (first, last)</li>
<li><strong>title</strong>: title of the book</li>
<li><strong>average_rating</strong>: average goodreads user rating of a
book</li>
<li><strong>ratings_count</strong>: the total count of ratings for a
book</li>
<li><strong>ratings_1</strong>: Total count of users who rated book as 1
star</li>
<li><strong>ratings_2</strong>: Total count of users who rated book as 2
star</li>
<li><strong>ratings_3</strong>: Total count of users who rated book as 3
star</li>
<li><strong>ratings_4</strong>: Total count of users who rated book as 4
star</li>
<li><strong>ratings_5</strong>: Total count of users who rated book as 5
star</li>
<li><strong>image_url</strong>: url link to book image</li>
<li><strong>top_1</strong>: first top tag for the book, used as a proxy
for genre</li>
<li><strong>top_2</strong>: second top tag for the book, used as a proxy
for genre</li>
<li><strong>top_3</strong>: third top tag for the book, used as a proxy
for genre</li>
<li><strong>top_4</strong>: fourth top tag for the book, used as a proxy
for genre</li>
<li><strong>top_5</strong>: fifth top tag for the book, used as a proxy
for genre</li>

<h3><strong>Exploratory Analysis</strong></h3>
<div id="who-are-the-top-fifteen-goodreads-users-by-ratings-and-to-read"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Who are the top fifteen Goodreads users, by Ratings and
To-Read?</strong></h4>
<p>To explore this question, we used the following datasets: <em>cleaned
books data</em>, <em>books_with_tags.csv</em>, <em>ratings.csv</em>, and
<em>to_read.csv</em>. Separate data frames were made to find the top 15
users by ratings and by number of to-read books.</p>
<p>For general analysis, the average rating by each of the top 15 users
was summarized. This distribution was visually compared to the average
ratings of the entire Goodreads community and found that the Top 15
ratings data was bimodal.</p>
<p>[insert graph]</p>
<p>The average rating among the Top 15 users was 3.756 while among the
community it was 3.929. The three most rated genres for the top 15 users
were found–exploratory analysis showed that there were too many tags per
book and too many ratings per user to have a clean descriptive analysis,
so top three rated genres for each user were found. The visualized data
looked at which of each user’s top three genres was most common among
the group of fifteen. Among the top 15 by ratings, the most popular
genres were fiction and classics, with all 15 of the 15 users having
fiction as one of their top three rating genres and 13 of the 15 users
having classics.</p>
<p>For the top 15 users by number of to-read, all of the books each of
the selected users were compiled and then analyzed to find the top 15
most popular books among the top 15 users. The first three most popular
were “The Catcher in the Rye”, “The Fault in Our Stars” and “A Tale of
Two Cities.” The top want-to-read genres were also analyzed among the
selected 15. First they were analyzed by looking at which genres were
most common and how many users had one of these genres as their top
three. Fiction (13/15), young adult (9/15), and fantasy (8/15) were the
most common genres among users’ top three genres. Then the next analysis
was looking at all data as a whole rather than by user. The top genre
tag for all distinct book titles were compiled to visualize in a bar
graph the most popular genres the top 15 users wanted to read overall.
The most popular genre was young adult, with 177 distinct titles to be
read, while others included classics (151) and fiction (124).</p>
</div>
<div id="are-sequels-worth-reading" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Are sequels worth reading?</strong></h4>
<p>To investigate whether sequels are worth the read, we start by
assessing the distribution of series lengths with a bar plot. We
utilized data from the <em>books_with_tags.csv</em> dataset and
conducted a string extraction to identify information on the order of
books within a series and series name, creating the variables
<strong>series_number</strong> and <strong>series_name</strong>. We also
created a series length variable by finding the maximum of the
series_number variable. These variables were created in a new dataset
called sequels. We plotted the distribution of series length on a
barplot and found that the majority of series are one book, with the
next largest groups being sequels and trilogies.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="report%20visualizations/series_distributions_boxplot.png"
alt="Boxplot of Series Distributions" />
<div class="figcaption">Boxplot of Series Distributions</div>
</div>
<p>We then filtered the sequels dataset to look at the average ratings
of the first two books of each series. To explore whether sequels are
rated higher than their original books, we used a box plot to visualize
the comparison between the average ratings of the first and second books
in a series. This box plot showed that the median rating for sequels is
slightly higher than that of the first book.</p>
<p>[insert graph here]</p>
<p>Next, to formally test whether sequels are rated higher than their
original works using statistical methods, we conducted an independent
two sample t-test comparing the average ratings of the first and second
books. We assessed normality using the box plots and found that the
distribution of average ratings appeared to be normal in both the first
and second books. The null and alternative hypotheses for the test are
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null hypothesis: The mean average rating of first books is equal to
the mean average rating of second books.</li>
<li>Alternative hypothesis: The mean average rating of first books is
not equal to the mean average rating of second books.</li>
</ul>
<p>[insert t test table]</p>
<p>The t-test results showed a p-value &lt; 0.05, indicating a
statistically significant difference between the two book groups. On
average, the sequel is rated 0.094 stars higher than the first books
(95% CI: 0.023, 0.165). These results support the hypothesis that on
average, sequels are better well-received than their original works by
good reads users.</p>
<p>Based on the analyses, most series tend to be shorter in length, with
single books, sequels, and trilogies being the most common.
Additionally, sequels tend to be rated higher than the first book, as
supported by visual representations and statistical testing. These
results suggest that readers may enjoy a continued storyline or
character development. The prevalence of shorter series lengths may
reflect reader preference or publishing company strategies to maximize
reader engagement.</p>
</div>
<div
id="what-are-the-top-10-most-and-least-popular-genres-among-read-books"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>What are the top 10 most and least popular genres, among
read books?</strong></h4>
<p>For the most and least popular genre analysis, we used the
<em>books_with_tags.csv</em> dataset (n=9300). We used the pivot_longer
function from the tidyr package to create a single column for tags,
called <em>tag</em>. This allowed me to analyze the most and least
popular genres based on tags.</p>
<p>After some descriptive analysis, we found that the most popular tag
is “fiction” and the third most popular tag is “non-fiction.” However,
some would argue that in modern literature these tags are considered the
broadest category of genre but do not provide information about the
specific fiction or nonfiction genres readers are reading or interested
in reading. Therefore, the decision to exclude these two categories was
made. There are 1,348 distinct genre categories, based on tags.</p>
<p>We grouped the data by tag value and then calculated the number of
occurrences for each tag. We then sorted the tags by count in descending
order and selected the top 10 most popular tags. A bar plot was created
to display the top 10 genres based on tags. The 10 most popular genres
read, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction,
Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and
Thriller.</p>
<p>A similar process as above was used to identify the 10 least popular
genres. We found there was a substantial number of tags that were only
used once, twice, or three times but this information was not useful
when presented on a bar graph. Therefore, we decided to exclude all tags
that have a tag count of less than 100. A cut off tag count of 100 was
used because we wanted to focus on tags that have a moderate level of
user engagement. By using a threshold of 100 for tag count, the analysis
ensures that the least popular genres identified still have sufficient
user recognition and can represent meaningful patterns in the data. The
10 least popular genres read, in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction,
Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade.</p>
</div>
<div
id="what-are-the-top-10-most-and-least-popular-genres-among-to-be-read-books"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>What are the top 10 most and least popular genres, among
to-be-read books?</strong></h4>
<p>For the most and least popular to-be-read genre analysis, we merged
the <em>to_read.csv</em> and <em>books_with_tags.csv</em> datasets on
<strong>book_id</strong> using an inner join, to create
<em>to_read_with_tags.csv</em>. We created a single column/variable for
tags and removed fiction and non-fiction tags, as done in the previous
analysis.</p>
<p>The same process was followed, as described above, to identify the 10
most popular and 10 least popular genres, among to-be-read books. The 10
most popular genres to-be-read, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy,
Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical
Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. The 10 least popular genres read,
in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ,
Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade.</p>
<p>The rankings were the same for books read and book to-be-read, this
was expected since we expect the genres that users are reading to be
similar to genres that users are planning to-read.This consistency
highlights a strong alignment between what users are reading and what
they plan to read, reinforcing the persistence of genre preferences
across user behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-most-and-least-popular-authors"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>What are the most and least popular authors?</strong></h4>
<p>To observe genre popularity, we started by calculating the total
number of ratings for each author from the <em>book_data.csv</em>. We
grouped authors and summarized by the total ratings using the sum()
function to determine the authors with the highest cumulative ratings.
We sorted the data in ascending order to determine the least-read
authors and descending order for the most-read authors based on their
total ratings. We then extracted the top 10 entries from each sorted
dataset to represent the most-read and least-read authors, respectively,
For popular authors, we calculated the percentage of total ratings
contributed by each author to assess their relative popularity within
the dataset. In order to do this, each of the author’s total ratings
were divided by hr overall sum of ratings and then multiplied (the
times) by 100. We then sorted the data in descending order based on the
percentages to display the top 10 popular authors.</p>
<p>The visualization of the least-read, most-read, and popular authors
were essential in displaying the descriptive analyses. We created bar
charts and tables using ggplot and knitr to display the data in an
accessible format. Bar charts and tables complemented each other by
providing both visual comparisons and detailed numerical information to
highlight trends in engagement across authors. For the least-read,
most-read and popular authors, we created bar charts to display the
total ratings of the authors with the highest, lowest and most
engagement. The least-read authors were sorted in ascending order,
displaying minimal engagement, while the most-read authors were sorted
in descending order to showcase those with the highest engagement. For
popular authors, we created a percentage-based bar chart to display the
relative contribution of each author’s ratings to the overall
dataset.</p>
<p>[insert graph]</p>
<p>Our analysis displaying the most-read authors included J.K. Rowling
and Suzanne Collins. These findings aligned with our expectations, as
these authors have written popular books such as the Harry Potter and
The Hunger Games series. In contrast, the least-read authors were those
with minimal engagement, often having only one book in the dataset. The
exploration of popular authors based on their percentage of total
ratings highlighted the relative impact of these authors in the overall
dataset. Authors like J.K. Rowling not only dominated in overall total
ratings but also in their percentage contributions, reflecting their
popularity compared to others. Our findings further underscored the
visibility of published works and its impact on the author’s readership.
Authors with more books in the dataset tended to have higher total
ratings, suggesting a cumulative effect of engagement. However, our
percentage analysis revealed that some authors achieve high relative
engagement even with fewer books, pointing to the quality of their
work.</p>

<div
id="how-can-we-build-a-recommendations-page-based-on-the-data-provided"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>How can we build a recommendations page based on the data
provided?</strong></h4>
<p>Using the Shiny App, we created a data-based book recommendations
page. Users can receive recommendations based on their favorite author,
genre, and preferred book rating. Once users fill out their information,
the app lists up to five books based on the user’s search criteria.
Below is a screenshot of the book recommendation page.</p>
<p>(Insert picture here once website is completely set up)</p>
<p>Starting with the <em>books_with_tags.csv</em> dataset, we restricted
the dataset to the variables of interest and rounded the
<strong>average_rating</strong> variable to the nearest half number.
After creating the final dataset, we built the User Interface. We added
conditions that allow users to select a genre or author to base their
recommendations on. Because some books were classified under multiple
genres, users can choose more than one genre to narrow their
recommendations. We also allow users to limit to a specific book rating,
no matter which search criteria they use. If no books match the
criteria, we alter the interface so that they will receive book
recommendations that still match their genre and author preference, but
will have a lower rating than they specified. We indicate that the book
listed is not based on their rating preference next to the book title.
We restricted the resulting list to five books.</p>

readers using Goodreads. We found the average rating among the Top 15
users was 3.756. Among those Top 15 readers, the most popular genres
were fiction and classics with the most popular books read being “The
Catcher in the Rye”, “The Fault in Our Stars” and “A Tale of Two
Cities.”</p>
<p>We investigated if sequels were worth reading, and found that most
series tend to be shorter in length, with single books, sequels, and
trilogies being the most common. Additionally, sequels tend to be rated
higher than the first book, suggesting that readers may enjoy a
continued storyline or character development.</p>
<p>We found that among read and to-be-read books, the 10 most popular
genres are Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Children,
Mystery, Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. The
10 least popular genres are Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War,
Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade. Additionally, the
most-read authors included J.K. Rowling and Suzanne Collins.</p>
<p>To help users find recommendations through our website, we created a
Recommendations page using the Shiny App. With these features users will
be recommended up to five books based on rating and author
preferences.</p>
<p>A limitation for our project is the lack of temporal information in
the Goodreads dataset we selected for our analyses; the dataset did not
include variables that specified when the data was collected or when
ratings were published. This absence of time-related variables limited
our ability to determine trends in genre, author, and book popularity.
Additionally, as we do not have information on when the dataset was
compiled, we cannot determine how relevant the ratings metrics are for
current reading trends.</p>
