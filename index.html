<h3><strong>About the Team</strong></h3>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
<p>With the New Year right around the corner, countless sources are
providing their list of the ‘Best Books’ of the year. These lists help
inform readers while providing them with book recommendations that
interest them. Our project aims to explore GoodReads data to understand
the genre and author preferences of readers in the United States.</p>
<p>We aim to identify the most and least read genres and authors to gain
insight into trends of literary engagement. With this information,
publishers, authors, and libraries can tailor their book selections to
meet reader’s demands and promote lesser-known genres and authors.
Understanding popular genres and authors can also help explore cultural
trends that resonate with the public, while identifying lesser-read
genres to create opportunities for re-engagement.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-inspiration" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Project Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>With the demanding workload of graduate school, there’s little time
to sit down and enjoy a good book. However, with winter break
approaching, we’re all looking forward to some much-needed rest and the
chance to indulge in quality reading time! This project was inspired by
a shared hobby among the team and our collective anticipation for the
opportunity to relax on the couch, sip some coffee, and dive into a good
book.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h3>
<p>The initial research question of our project was: What are trends
among readers? This initial research question aided us when exploring
datasets. Once we found the <a
href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">GoodRead-10k</a>, an
open data source hosted on GitHub with data from GoodReads, we were
interested in exploring trends among readers using GoodReads. The team
spent time understand what data was available and then created the
following questions to guide this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the top fifteen GoodReads users, by Ratings and
To-Read?<br />
</li>
<li>Are sequels worth reading?<br />
</li>
<li>What are the top 10 most popular genres? What are the 10 least
popular genres?<br />
</li>
<li>Who are the top 10 most popular authors? Who are the 10 least
popular authors?<br />
</li>
<li>How can we build a recommendations page based on the data
provided?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="report" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Report</strong></h3>
<div id="users" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Users</strong></h4>
<p>The data used were the cleaned books data, books_with_tags.csv,
ratings.csv, and to_read.csv. Separate dataframes were made to find the
top 15 users by ratings and by number of to-read books.</p>
<p>For general analysis, the average rating by each of the top 15 users
was summarized. This distribution was visually compared to the average
ratings of the entire GoodReads community and found that the Top 15
ratings data was bimodal. The average rating among the Top 15 users was
3.756 while among the community it was 3.929. The three most rated
genres for the top 15 users were found–exploratory analysis showed that
there were too many tags per book and too many ratings per user to have
a clean descriptive analysis, so top three rated genres for each user
were found. The visualized data looked at which of each user’s top three
genres was most common among the group of fifteen. Among the top 15 by
ratings, the most popular genres were fiction and classics, with all 15
of the 15 users having fiction as one of their top three rating genres
and 13 of the 15 users having classics.</p>
<p>For the top 15 users by number of to-read, all of the books each of
the selected users were compiled and then analyzed to find the top 15
most popular books among the top 15 users. The first three most popular
were “The Catcher in the Rye”, “The Fault in Our Stars” and “A Tale of
Two Cities.” The top want-to-read genres were also analyzed among the
selected 15. First they were analyzed by looking at which genres were
most common and how many users had one of these genres as their top
three. Fiction (13/15), young adult (9/15), and fantasy (8/15) were the
most common genres among users’ top three genres. Then the next analysis
was looking at all data as a whole rather than by user. The top genre
tag for all distinct book titles were compiled to visualize in a bar
graph the most popular genres the top 15 users wanted to read overall.
The most popular genre was young adult, with 177 distinct titles to be
read, while others included classics (151) and fiction (124).</p>
</div>
<div id="sequels" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Sequels</strong></h4>
</div>
<div id="genres" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Genres</strong></h4>
<p>For the genre section of this analysis, I used the Books with Tags
dataset. This dataset had a sample size of 9300 books and each book has
five top tags. On GoodReads, tags are non-exclusive virtual shelves that
users can organize their books on. In the raw data, books had between
1-25 tags, we took the five most common tags for each book and kept
those in the books_with_tags.csv dataset. The tags in this dataset are
used as proxies for genres and will provide insight into the genres that
users have characterized books as.</p>
<p>For the most and least popular genre analysis I used the
books_with_tags.csv dataset. I used the pivot_longer function from the
tidyr package to create a single column/variable for tags. This allowed
me to analyze the most and least popular genres based on tags.</p>
<p>After some descriptive analysis, I found that the most popular tag is
“fiction” and the third most popular tag is “non-fiction.” However, some
would argue that in modern literature these tags are considered the
broadest category of genre but do not provide information about the
specific fiction or nonfiction genres readers are reading or interested
in reading. Therefore, the decision to exclude these two categories was
made. There are 1,348 distinct genre categories, based on tags.</p>
<p>For the most and least popular to-be-read genre analysis I merged the
to_read.csv and books_with_tags.csv datasets on book_id using an inner
join, referred to as the to_read_with_tag.csv from here forward. I
created a single column/variable for tags and removed fiction and
non-fiction tags. After creating the single tag column, I grouped the
data by tag value and then calculated the number of occurrences for each
tag. I then sorted the tags by count in descending order and selected
the top 10 most popular tags. A bar plot was created to display the top
10 genres based on tags. The 10 most popular genres read, in order, are:
Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery,
Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller.</p>
<p>I followed a similar process as above but found that there was a
substantial number of tags that were only used once, twice, or three
times but this information was not useful when presented on a bar graph.
Therefore, I decided to exclude all tags that have a tag count of less
than 100. A cut off tag count of 100 was used because I wanted to focus
on tags that have a moderate level of user engagement. By using a
threshold of 100 for tag count, the analysis ensures that the least
popular genres identified still have sufficient user recognition and can
represent meaningful patterns in the data.</p>
<p>The 10 least popular genres read, in order, are: Manga, Adult
Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle
Grade</p>
<p>For this analysis, I followed the same process outlined in “Most
popular read genres” above, but using the to_read_with_tag.csv file. The
10 most popular genres to-be-read, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy,
Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical
Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller.</p>
<p>For this analysis, I followed the same process outlined in “Least
popular read genres” above, but using the to_read_with_tag.csv file. The
10 least popular genres read, in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction,
Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade.</p>
<p>The 10 most popular genres, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy,
Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical
Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. The 10 least popular genres, in
order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ,
Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade. The rankings were the same for books
read and book to-be-read, this was expected since we expect the genres
that users are reading should be the same/similar genres that other
users are planning to-read. Due to book recommendation, social media,
and book communities readers can easily find books to read that are of
interest to them. Additionally, given that readers often have a genre
that they enjoy, book recommendations or books to-read will likely be
within that same genre further supporting the conclusion that rankings
were the same for books read and book to-be-read.</p>
</div>
<div id="authors" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Authors</strong></h4>
<p>To perform the exploratory analysis, the total number of ratings for
each author was calculated using the book data. The book data was
grouped by authors and then summarized by the total ratings using sum()
function. This process identified the authors with the highest
cumulative ratings. To analyze the least and most-read authors, the data
was sorted in ascending order for least-read authors and descending
order for the most-read authors based on the total ratings. The top 10
entries from each sorted dataset were then extracted for analysis,
representing the most-read and least-read authors, respectively, For
popular authors, the percentage of total ratings contributed by each
author was calculated to assess their relative popularity within the
dataset. In order to do this, each of the author’s total ratings were
divided by hr overall sum of ratings and then multiplied (the times) by
100. The data was then sorted in descending order based on the
percentages to display the top 10 popular authors.</p>
<p>The visualization of the least-read, most-read, and popular authors
were essential in displaying the descriptive analyses. Bar charts and
tables were created using ggplot and knitr to display the data in an
accessible format. Bar charts and tables complemented each other by
providing both visual comparisons and detailed numerical information to
highlight trends in engagement across authors. For the least-read,
most-read and popular authors, bar charts were created to display the
total ratings of the authors with the highest, lowest and most
engagement. The least-read authors were sorted in ascending order,
displaying minimal engagement, while the most-read authors were sorted
in descending order to showcase those with the highest engagement. For
popular authors, a percentage-based bar chart was created to display the
relative contribution of each author’s ratings to the overall
dataset.</p>
<p>While there were no formal statistical test as the primary focus was
to conduct an exploratory descriptive analysis, potential analyses could
include a statistical comparison between groups of authors, such as the
average ratings of least-read versus most-read authors to determine
whether the differences in total ratings across groups are statistically
significant. Similarly, for popular authors, further statistical
analyses could focus on the relationship between percentage of total
ratings and the number of books published.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis displayed the most-read authors included J.K.
Rowling and Suzanne Collins. These findings aligned with expectations,
as these authors have written popular books such as the Harry Potter and
The Hunger Games series. In contrast, the least-read authors were those
with minimal engagement, often having only one book in the dataset. The
exploration of popular authors based on their percentage of total
ratings highlighted the relative impact of these authors in the overall
dataset. Authors like J.K. Rowling not only dominated in overall total
ratings but also in their percentage contributions, reflecting their
popularity compared to others. The findings furthered underscored the
visibility of published works and its impact in author’s readership.
Authors with more books in the dataset tended to have higher total
ratings, suggesting a cumulative effect of engagement. However, the
percentage analysis revealed that some authors achieve high relative
engagement even with fewer books, pointing to the quality of their
work.</p>
</div>
<div id="recommendations-list" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Recommendations List</strong></h4>
<p>Using the Shiny App, we created a data-based book recommendations
page. Users can receive recommendations based on their favorite author,
genre, and preferred book rating. Once users fill out their information,
the app lists up to five books based on the user’s search criteria.
Below is a screenshot of the book recommendation page.</p>
<p>Starting with the books_with_tags.csv dataset, we restricted the
dataset to the variables of interest and rounded the ‘average_rating’
variable to the nearest half number. After creating the final dataset,
we built the User Interface. We added conditions that allow users to
select a genre or author to base their recommendations on. Because some
books were classified under multiple genres, users can choose more than
one genre to narrow their recommendations. We also allow users to limit
to a specific book rating, no matter which search criteria they use. If
no books match the criteria, we altered the interface so that they will
receive book recommendations that still match their genre and author
preference, but will have a lower rating than they specified. We
indicate that the book listed is not based on their rating preference
next to the book title. We restricted the resulting list to five
books.</p>
