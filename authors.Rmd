## Summarizing Read Counts by Author 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
author_summary <- books %>%
  group_by(authors) %>%
  summarize(
    total_reads = sum(read_count, na.rm = TRUE),
    num_books = n() 
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_reads))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
