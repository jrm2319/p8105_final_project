### **About the Team**

### **Motivation**
With the New Year right around the corner, countless sources are providing their list of the ‘Best Books’ of the year. These lists help inform readers while providing them with book recommendations that interest them. Our project aims to explore GoodReads data to understand the genre and author preferences of readers in the United States.  

We aim to identify the most and least read genres and authors to gain insight into trends of literary engagement. With this information, publishers, authors, and libraries can tailor their book selections to meet reader's demands and promote lesser-known genres and authors. Understanding popular genres and authors can also help explore cultural trends that resonate with the public, while identifying lesser-read genres to create opportunities for re-engagement.

### **Project Inspiration**
With the demanding workload of graduate school, there’s little time to sit down and enjoy a good book. However, with winter break approaching, we’re all looking forward to some much-needed rest and the chance to indulge in quality reading time! This project was inspired by a shared hobby among the team and our collective anticipation for the opportunity to relax on the couch, sip some coffee, and dive into a good book.  

### **Initial Questions**
The initial research question of our project was: What are trends among readers? This initial research question aided us when exploring datasets. Once we found the [GoodRead-10k](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k), an open data source hosted on GitHub with data from GoodReads, we were interested in exploring trends among readers using GoodReads. The team spent time understand what data was available and then created the following questions to guide this project:  

- Who are the top fifteen GoodReads users, by Ratings and To-Read?   
- Are sequels worth reading?  
- What are the top 10 most popular genres? What are the 10 least popular genres?   
- Who are the top 10 most popular authors? Who are the 10 least popular authors?   
- How can we build a recommendations page based on the data provided?   

### **Report** 
#### **Users**

The data used were the cleaned books data, books_with_tags.csv, ratings.csv, and to_read.csv. Separate dataframes were made to find the top 15 users by ratings and by number of to-read books.

For general analysis, the average rating by each of the top 15 users was summarized. This distribution was visually compared to the average ratings of the entire GoodReads community and found that the Top 15 ratings data was bimodal. The average rating among the Top 15 users was 3.756 while among the community it was 3.929. The three most rated genres for the top 15 users were found–exploratory analysis showed that there were too many tags per book and too many ratings per user to have a clean descriptive analysis, so top three rated genres for each user were found. The visualized data looked at which of each user’s top three genres was most common among the group of fifteen. Among the top 15 by ratings, the most popular genres were fiction and classics, with all 15 of the 15 users having fiction as one of their top three rating genres and 13 of the 15 users having classics. 

For the top 15 users by number of to-read, all of the books each of the selected users were compiled and then analyzed to find the top 15 most popular books among the top 15 users. The first three most popular were “The Catcher in the Rye”, “The Fault in Our Stars” and “A Tale of Two Cities.” The top want-to-read genres were also analyzed among the selected 15. First they were analyzed by looking at which genres were most common and how many users had one of these genres as their top three. Fiction (13/15), young adult (9/15), and fantasy (8/15) were the most common genres among users’ top three genres. Then the next analysis was looking at all data as a whole rather than by user. The top genre tag for all distinct book titles were compiled to visualize in a bar graph the most popular genres the top 15 users wanted to read overall. The most popular genre was young adult, with 177 distinct titles to be read, while others included classics (151) and fiction (124).

#### **Sequels**



#### **Genres** 

For the genre section of this analysis, I used the Books with Tags dataset. This dataset had a sample size of 9300 books and each book has five top tags. On GoodReads, tags are non-exclusive virtual shelves that users can organize their books on. In the raw data, books had between 1-25 tags, we took the five most common tags for each book and kept those in the books_with_tags.csv dataset. The tags in this dataset are used as proxies for genres and will provide insight into the genres that users have characterized books as. 

For the most and least popular genre analysis I used the books_with_tags.csv dataset. I used the pivot_longer function from the tidyr package to create a single column/variable for tags. This allowed me to analyze the most and least popular genres based on tags. 

After some descriptive analysis, I found that the most popular tag is “fiction” and the third most popular tag is “non-fiction.” However, some would argue that in modern literature these tags are considered the broadest category of genre but do not provide information about the specific fiction or nonfiction genres readers are reading or interested in reading. Therefore, the decision to exclude these two categories was made. There are 1,348 distinct genre categories, based on tags.  

For the most and least popular to-be-read genre analysis I merged the to_read.csv and books_with_tags.csv datasets on book_id using an inner join, referred to as the to_read_with_tag.csv from here forward. I created a single column/variable for tags and removed fiction and non-fiction tags. 
After creating the single tag column, I grouped the data by tag value and then calculated the number of occurrences for each tag. I then sorted the tags by count in descending order and selected the top 10 most popular tags. A bar plot was created to display the top 10 genres based on tags. The 10 most popular genres read, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. 

I followed a similar process as above but found that there was a substantial number of tags that were only used once, twice, or three times but this information was not useful when presented on a bar graph. Therefore, I decided to exclude all tags that have a tag count of less than 100. A cut off tag count of 100 was used because I wanted to focus on tags that have a moderate level of user engagement. By using a threshold of 100 for tag count, the analysis ensures that the least popular genres identified still have sufficient user recognition and can represent meaningful patterns in the data.  
	
The 10 least popular genres read, in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade 

For this analysis, I followed the same process outlined in “Most popular read genres” above, but using the to_read_with_tag.csv file. The 10 most popular genres to-be-read, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. 

For this analysis, I followed the same process outlined in “Least popular read genres” above, but using the to_read_with_tag.csv file. The 10 least popular genres read, in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade. 

The 10 most popular genres, in order, are: Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Children, Mystery, Classics, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, and Thriller. The 10 least popular genres, in order, are: Manga, Adult Fiction, Religion, Art, War, Memoirs, IGBTQ, Poetry, Drama, and Middle Grade. The rankings were the same for books read and book to-be-read, this was expected since we expect the genres that users are reading should be the same/similar genres that other users are planning to-read. Due to book recommendation, social media, and book communities readers can easily find books to read that are of interest to them. Additionally, given that readers often have a genre that they enjoy, book recommendations or books to-read will likely be within that same genre further supporting the conclusion that rankings were the same for books read and book to-be-read. 

#### **Authors**

To perform the exploratory analysis, the total number of ratings for each author was calculated using the book data. The book data was grouped by authors and then summarized by the total ratings using sum() function. This process identified the authors with the highest cumulative ratings. To analyze the least and most-read authors, the data was sorted in ascending order for least-read authors and descending order for the most-read authors based on the total ratings. The top 10 entries from each sorted dataset were then extracted for analysis, representing the most-read and least-read authors, respectively, For popular authors, the percentage of total ratings contributed by each author was calculated to assess their relative popularity within the dataset. In order to do this, each of the author's total ratings were divided by hr overall sum of ratings and then multiplied (the times) by 100. The data was then sorted in descending order based on the percentages to display the top 10 popular authors.  

The visualization of the least-read, most-read, and popular authors were essential in displaying the descriptive analyses. Bar charts and tables were created using ggplot and knitr to display the data in an accessible format. Bar charts and tables complemented each other by providing both visual comparisons and detailed numerical information to highlight trends in engagement across authors.  For the least-read, most-read and popular authors, bar charts were created to display the total ratings of the authors with the highest, lowest and most engagement. The least-read authors were sorted in ascending order, displaying minimal engagement, while the most-read authors were sorted in descending order to showcase those with the highest engagement. For popular authors, a percentage-based bar chart was created to display the relative contribution of each author’s ratings to the overall dataset. 

While there were no formal statistical test as the primary focus was to conduct an exploratory descriptive analysis, potential analyses could include a statistical comparison between groups of authors, such as the average ratings of least-read versus most-read authors to determine whether the differences in total ratings across groups are statistically significant. Similarly, for popular authors, further statistical analyses could focus on the relationship between percentage of total ratings and the number of books published. 

Moreover, the analysis displayed the most-read authors included J.K. Rowling and Suzanne Collins. These findings aligned with expectations, as these authors have written popular books such as the Harry Potter and The Hunger Games series. In contrast, the least-read authors were those with minimal engagement, often having only one book in the dataset. The exploration of popular authors based on their percentage of total ratings highlighted the relative impact of these authors in the overall dataset. Authors like J.K. Rowling not only dominated in overall total ratings but also in their percentage contributions, reflecting their popularity compared to others. The findings furthered underscored the visibility of published works and its impact in author’s readership. Authors with more books in the dataset tended to have higher total ratings, suggesting a cumulative effect of engagement. However, the percentage analysis revealed that some authors achieve high relative engagement even with fewer books, pointing to the quality of their work.

#### **Recommendations List**
Using the Shiny App, we created a data-based book recommendations page. Users can receive recommendations based on their favorite author, genre, and preferred book rating. Once users fill out their information, the app lists up to five books based on the user’s search criteria. Below is a screenshot of the book recommendation page. 

Starting with the books_with_tags.csv dataset, we restricted the dataset to the variables of interest and rounded the ‘average_rating’ variable to the nearest half number. After creating the final dataset, we built the User Interface. We added conditions that allow users to select a genre or author to base their recommendations on. Because some books were classified under multiple genres, users can choose more than one genre to narrow their recommendations. We also allow users to limit to a specific book rating, no matter which search criteria they use. If no books match the criteria, we altered the interface so that they will receive book recommendations that still match their genre and author preference, but will have a lower rating than they specified. We indicate that the book listed is not based on their rating preference next to the book title. We restricted the resulting list to five books.
