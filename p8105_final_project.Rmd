**The motivation for this project**: 
For this project, we would like to better understand reader’s genre and author preferences in the United States. By identifying which genres and authors are most and less read, as well as frequently kept/unkept, we can gain insights into trends of literary engagement. This information could provide publishers, authors, and libraries insight into tailoring their offerings to meet reader’s demand and promoting less-read genres. Understanding popular genres and authors can also help explore cultural trends that resonate with the general public while identifying lesser-read genres to create opportunities for re-engagement.
